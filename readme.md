# web-scraping-challenge
The Module 11 Challenge consists of two technical products:
* Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles
* Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table

**Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News**
* Automated browsing was used to visit the Mars news site, and the HTML code was extracted
* The titles and preview text of the news articles were scraped and extracted
* The scraped information was stored as a list of dictionaries

**Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data**<br>
*The HTML table was extracted into a Pandas DataFrame and the data was analyzed to answer the following questions:*
* How many months exist on Mars?
* How many Martian days' worth of data are there?

*The data was analyzed to answer the following questions, and a data visualization was created to support each answer:*
* Which month, on average, has the lowest temperature? The highest?
* Which month, on average, has the lowest atmospheric pressure? The highest?
* How many terrestrial days exist in a Martian year?

The DataFrame was exported into a mars_analysis.CSV file.
